I'm a PhD student in the [ARGO team](https://team.inria.fr/argo/) at [Inria](https://www.inria.fr) Paris under the supervision of [Marc Lelarge](https://www.di.ens.fr/~lelarge/).  
I'm working for [Renault](https://www.renaultgroup.com) on GPS data from connected vehicles and traffic flows.  
My research interests include learning on spatial and temporal data, physics and graphs.
