I'm a PhD student in the [ARGO team](https://www.di.ens.fr/argo/) at [Inria Paris](https://www.inria.fr) under the supervision of [Marc Lelarge](https://www.di.ens.fr/~lelarge/).  
I'm working for [Renault](https://www.renaultgroup.com) on GPS data from connected vehicles and traffic flows, lead by [Mustafa Al Bakri](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mustafa-al-bakri). 
My research interests include learning on spatial and temporal data, physics and graphs.
